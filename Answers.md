- Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.

    A relational database is the type of database. Relational dbs have tables that can have relations with other tables via having columns that contain id values of other tables. SQL is the language used to query relational dbs.

- Why do tables need a primary key?

    A primary key serves as a unique identifier specificially for the row of data that exist in that table. 

- What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

    We would name that column as [another table's name]_id

- What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

    We would need an intermediate table that houses both primary keys from both tables.
